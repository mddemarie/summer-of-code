Rails Girls Summer of Code is an <a href="/blog/2016-06-01-ruby-heroes-2016" target="_blank">award-winning</a> global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into Open Source. It welcomes all women and non-binary applicants who want to gain a footing in the world of coding and further expand their knowledge and skills. The focus is on advanced-beginners who want to enter programming full-time.

As a fellowship program, successful applicants are paid a monthly stipend, from July to September. This breaks down all-too-common financial barriers, allowing students to work on a worthwhile Open Source project.

Working in two-person teams, students are supported by a mentor directly involved with the Open Source project, and independent coaches with extensive developer experience.

## Help make Open Source a better place for everyone

Rails Girls Summer of Code wants to bring more diversity into Open Source. According to GitHub’s 2017 <a href="https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/" target="_blank">Open Source Survey</a> “[t]he gender imbalance in open source remains profound... just 3% are women and 1% are non-binary”.

To encourage more diversity, the tech environment needs to be less toxic to women, non-binary people and other minorities. Adhering to and respecting the program’s [Code of Conduct](/about/code-of-conduct) is essential for anyone participating in Rails Girls Summer of Code. This ensures the program is a safe space for everyone involved.

## Who is behind Rails Girls Summer of Code

RGSoC is a project run by not-for-profit organization <a href="https://foundation.travis-ci.org" target="_blank">Travis Foundation</a>. It operates solely on the generous donations of sponsors and individuals from the community.

The scholarship program started in 2013. Since then, RGSoC has supported 205 students working in 81 sponsored teams and 28 volunteering teams. In 2018 we welcomed our first part-time teams.

Rails Girls Summer of Code is programming language agnostic, and students have contributed to an overall of 76 unique Open Source projects such as Bundler, Rails, Discourse, Tessel, NextCloud, Processing, Babel, impress.js, Lektor CMS, Hoodie, Speakerinnen, Lotus (now Hanami) and Servo.

Since its inception, Rails Girls Summer of Code has been supported by companies like Travis CI, GitHub, Google, GitLab, Envato, Basecamp, and SoundCloud to name a few. At the same time, thousands of people have backed this initiative individually.
