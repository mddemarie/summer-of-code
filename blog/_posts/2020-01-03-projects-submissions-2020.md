Are you working on an Open Source project you think would be perfect for a coding near-beginner to work on? What luck! RGSoC is accepting **project submissions** for the 2020 season starting from **06 January 2020** üòÑ

Simply apply in the [Teams App](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) before **9am, Monday 10 February 2020** CET.

## Get familiar with the basics

What makes a really good RGSoC project? Full details are available on our [mentors page](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/), which we recommend you read before applying.

There are some basic requirements. Keep in mind every project needs:
<ul>
<li> a mentor, the dedicated contact person for the team throughout the program</li>
<li> <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching/" target="_blank">coaches</a> (min 2, max 4) who offer students all-important day-to-day support</li>
<li> to be beginner-/junior-friendly</li>
<li> at least one open-source license</li>
<li> to abide by the RGSoC <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a></li>
</ul>

One thing you don‚Äôt need to worry about is using Rails. Despite the name, Rails Girls Summer of Code is programming language agnostic. Former projects have used Python, Rust, and Javascript, to name a few.

## What next?

After the deadline (9am, **Monday 10 February 2020** CET, remember), our team will look through all the submissions and announce successful projects in early February. While not every project will be chosen for the program, we value every entry. The sheer variety of projects makes RGSoC such a rich and rewarding experience.

Selected projects should shout about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Rails-Girls-Summer-of-Code-620914904656191/). It‚Äôs a superb way to connect with students and get some love for your project.

In March and April, potential student contributors will have the chance to apply for the program and choose the project(s) they wish to work on. They may contact you (or whoever is the project [mentor](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/)) for more details to make sure it‚Äôs the right project for them.

## Using the Teams App

Sure, you know your way around a computer. Even so, we want to make it easy for you to apply with this step-by-step guide on how to add projects to the Teams App. Did we mention the deadline for submissions is 9am, **Monday 10 February 2020** CET?

* Sign up for the [Teams App](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)
* Authenticate with [GitHub](https://github.com/) (you‚Äôll need an account)
* Click on ‚ÄúSubmit your project‚Äù under ‚ÄúSummer of Code‚Äù in the navigation bar
* The submitter (you) is entered as the primary mentor by default. If that isn‚Äôt the case, enter the correct name, email address and GitHub handle
* Add the project name, website, repo, and description, including:
  * what the project is about
  * what stage it‚Äôs currently at
  * a few words about the team behind it
* If your project has additional coaches to help the students during the program, add their information in the description
* Add features and tasks: outline how you imagine the students to contribute, features you‚Äôre planning to work on, issues that need help
* Add requirements: describe skills and experience students should bring to work on the project, e.g.
  * Provide a small example or coding challenge for students to solve upfront
  * Add links to online courses or katas students should be confident with
  * Frame possible features students could work on
  * Or just ask the students to contact you for more information about requirements
* Add keywords: this can be a language like ‚ÄúPython‚Äù or a framework like ‚ÄúReact‚Äù, but also specific technologies or concepts
* Add the name of your license in the ‚Äúlicense‚Äù field
* You can flag your project as ‚Äúsuitable for beginners‚Äù by using the available checkbox
* Click Submit

Well done! You‚Äôve taken the first step to becoming an RGSoC legend.
