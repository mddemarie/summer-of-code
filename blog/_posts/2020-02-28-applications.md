It has been a bumper year for project submissions. Our dedicated volunteer reviewers (thanks, team) have spent the past few weeks, in a haze of caffeine, reading, evaluating and discussing all 48 proposals and have just finished making their (often taxing) decisions. Phew!

We thank everyone who entered a project. While we cannot take them all to the next stage, they were all incredibly interesting and had a lot of merit. As a result of being on our Teams App, some people have already started contributing to the projects that weren‚Äôt chosen, so they will still benefit from the process. The RGSoC community is amazing! üòç

### Students, start prepping!

Now for some really exciting news. **RGSoC student applications have officially started on Monday, 02 March 2020.**

Here‚Äôs your chance to join a global movement that champions underrepresented groups in the field of tech. If you identify as female or non-binary, have at least 12 months‚Äô experience of coding, and possess a passion to progress as a developer then you‚Äôre in the right place!

RGSoC offers a:

* unique opportunity to learn while making valuable OS contributions

* 3-month community-funded scholarship (01 July - 30 September 2020)

* network of mentors, coaches, and supervisors who offer code-based and non-technical support throughout the program

* choice of incredible open source projects to contribute to while you learn

* chance to kick-start (or change into) a career in programming career with valuable experience on your CV/resume

Sounds good, eh?

Everything you need to know about applying can be found in the [student guide](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/) so please make sure the first thing you do is read it carefully.

**When you‚Äôve organised your teammate, apply in the Teams App at [https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/apply](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/apply)**

Don‚Äôt forget, your [teammate](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/finding-your-team/) should be living in the same region so that you can meet up every day. And remember, you‚Äôll be working together for many, many hours over the three months, so it is a good idea to pair with someone you get on with well.

### Good to know

After the application stage closes on 30 March, our courageous band of reviewers will read each and every entry and face the most difficult part of the RGSoC calendar - choosing the successful candidates.

While we‚Äôd prefer to offer a place to everyone, the number of scholarships relies on the success of our fundraising campaign. So if you know anyone who can support it, please refer them to [https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/
](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/). Who wouldn‚Äôt be tempted to see their name in lights in exchange for a small donation? Well, on the RGSoC website, anyway.

To help you make a stronger application, think about including details of:

* how long you have been coding and what you already (like to) contribute to

* any communities you are involved with, such as meetups, workshops or conferences

* dreams, goals, long term plans

* details you may have discussed with the project maintainer/mentor that led you to choose the RGSoC project(s) in your application

* experience of co-working (good and bad - especially if you resolved any issues)

It‚Äôs best to start filling the application form early, even if you‚Äôre still searching for [coaches](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching/) and/or a [working space](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company/).

Your application can be saved as a draft for you to continue and submit any time before the deadline. That‚Äôs **23:00 UTC on 30 March 2020, remember.** Sorry, but any applications received after that time cannot be considered.

### Your choice of projects

We‚Äôve got a whole host of delectable [open source projects](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects) for you to choose from this year. A list of projects and links to read more about each one is included below. We're now [crowdfunding](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) to ensure as many student teams and projects can partificapte in RGSoC starting in July.

Your coaches should be able to advise which projects would be good for you to choose, considering the languages they involve and difficulty level of the tasks. Of course, it‚Äôs also important the project interests you, so always keep that in mind.

### Volunteer reviewers
In 2018, we received 195 applications from student teams. We hope to have even half that number again this year, but it also means there is a lot of work ahead of us. It takes time to read and review all those applications, and we can‚Äôt do it without help.

If you are interested in joining our reviewer team, then please email us on [contact@rgsoc.org](mailto:contact@rgsoc.org). (As much as we appreciate all offers, in the interest of being fair applicants cannot also be reviewers.)

Good luck for your applications. We can‚Äôt wait to read them!
